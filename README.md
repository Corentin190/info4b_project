How to read a pgn file :

K : king\n
Q : queen\n
R : rook\n
B : bishop\n
N : knight (or S)\n
  : pawn\n
  
x : capture (or :)\n

\# : end of the game (Checkmate : the king is in check and there is no possible escape : the opponent wins)

Score : 1-0 (white wins)
0-1 (black wins)

ex : gxh6 : pawn from g column takes h6

The player with the white pieces always moves first.

ex : 1. e4 e6 â€”> first moves : white pawn moves to e4 and black pawn moves to e6
